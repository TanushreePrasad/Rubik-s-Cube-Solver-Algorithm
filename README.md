Korf's IDA* Algorithm for solving a Rubik's Cube

Rubik's Cube Solver - Using Korf's IDA*                                                                                  Jul 2024 - Aug 2024 
• Modeled a virtual Rubik's cube(3x3) in 3 different models/classes using standard data structures in C++ language.
 • Achieved a solving time of 4 seconds for a Rubik's cube jumbled 9 times, using BFS, DFS, and IDDFS algorithms.
 • Implemented Korf's IDA* Algorithm, achieving a solve time of under 11 seconds for a cube scrambled 13 times.
